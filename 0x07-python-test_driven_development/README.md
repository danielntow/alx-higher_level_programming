## TESTING IN PYTHON


# Python Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project focuses on Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices using Python. TDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It ensures code reliability, maintainability, and correctness.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielntow/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-test_driven_development
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



### Running Tests

To run tests using TDD principles, use the following command:

```bash

python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```
