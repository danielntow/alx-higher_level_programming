This repository is dedicated to exploring Data Structures and Functional Programming concepts in Python. It will guide you through the fundamentals of these topics, helping you understand how to work with various data structures and utilize functional programming techniques effectively.

## Data Structures

Data structures are essential components in computer science and programming. They provide organized ways to store and manipulate data. In this section, we'll explore some common data structures in Python:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

Each data structure has its own unique properties and use cases. We will provide examples and explain how to work with these data structures efficiently.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In Python, you can apply functional programming concepts using tools like Lambda, filter, reduce, and map.

### Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a concise way to create small, unnamed functions. We will delve into lambda functions and demonstrate how they can be used in various scenarios.

### Filter

The `filter` function in Python allows you to filter elements from an iterable based on a provided function. You'll learn how to use `filter` to select elements that meet specific criteria.

### Map

The `map` function applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns a map object that can be converted into other iterable types. We will show you how to use `map` to transform and process data efficiently.

### Reduce

The `reduce` function, available in the `functools` module, is used for cumulative computations on a list of items. We will explore how `reduce` works and provide examples of its usage.

By studying data structures and functional programming in Python, you will enhance your ability to write clean, efficient, and readable code.
