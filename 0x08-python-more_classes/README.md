# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The focus of this resource is to provide an in-depth understanding of various OOP concepts and their implementation using Python.

## Learning Objectives

The aim of this project is to enable a solid comprehension of the following OOP principles in Python:

- Understanding the fundamental concepts and benefits of Python programming's Object-Oriented approach.
- Exploring the concept of "first-class everything" and its implications in Python.
- Grasping the core concepts such as classes, objects, and instances.
- Distinguishing between classes and objects/instances, and comprehending their relationship.
- Exploring attributes and their categorization as public, protected, and private.
- Understanding the significance of the `self` parameter in methods within Python classes.
- Working with methods and special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`).
- Implementing Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- Distinguishing between attributes and properties in Python.
- Understanding the Pythonic way to write getters and setters.
- Recognizing and utilizing class attributes effectively.
- Understanding class methods and static methods in Python.
- Learning to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for class instances.
- Exploring the `__dict__` attribute and its usage in Python classes.
- Discovering how Python resolves attributes in objects and classes.
- Utilizing the `getattr` function for attribute access in Python.
