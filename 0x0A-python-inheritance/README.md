# Python Inheritance

Inheritance in Python is a mechanism where a class can derive properties and behavior from another class. It enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) that acquire attributes and methods from existing classes (base or parent classes).

### Types of Inheritance Covered:
- Basic Inheritance
- Single Inheritance
- Multi-level Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Super() Function
- Method Overriding
- Class Hierarchy

Inheritance allows for code reusability and promotes a hierarchical structure of classes, enabling specialization and extension of functionality.
