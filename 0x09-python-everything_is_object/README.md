# Everything is an Object in Python

In Python, everything is an object. This means that even the most basic data types, like integers and strings, are implemented as objects. Objects in Python have attributes and methods, making it a truly object-oriented language.

## Key Points:
- Python is an object-oriented programming language.
- All data types, variables, and functions in Python are objects.
- Objects have attributes (characteristics) and methods (functions) associated with them.
- You can create your own custom objects and classes in Python.

Python's object-oriented nature allows you to work with a wide range of data types and use powerful features like inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable and organized code.

Remember, in Python, everything is an object, and this concept is at the core of its design and flexibility.
